            Western Australia. According to the Wajjari dictionary, “GAMBARRA” means “fresh” or “new”.</p>

            <h3>The WHY</h3>
            <p>An indigenous-owned Australian business with global aspirations, we service the technology-powered
                business needs of enterprise and government organizations to fund and support our people’s aspirations
                to employment, training and business opportunities. We create these learning opportunities and
                meaningful pathways for the indigenous community, while enabling them to work out of their cultural
                lands.</p>
            <h3>The HOW</h3>
            <p>We are all about “Business Evolution” over “Business Transformation”, “Customer Centricity” over “Product
                Centricity”, “Experience Level Agreements” over “Service Level Agreements” and “Value Co-creation” over
                “Technology Collaboration”.</p>
            <p>Our approach is to first understand a customer’s unique market value proposition, following which we help
                identify what business objectives will help them better serve their customers and operate profitably.
                Our purpose-built business solutions are always an outcome of what’s needed to meet these objectives
                with “purpose” at the core of any solution strategy.</p>
            <h3>The WHAT</h3>
            <p>We endeavor to simplify your life by tidying up your to-do list. From the unglamorous grunt work of
                identifying the most appropriate, robust and secure technology solution for your business problem to
                delivery and lifecycle management of the solution, we strive to bring much-needed sanity within the
                noisy and complex IoT/AI ecosystem.</p>
            <p>As a solutions aggregator, ours is an ecosystem-powered business, delivering cutting-edge digital
                technologies and experiences through a “team of teams” approach. Businesses extract value from these
                engagements by creating new revenue streams, increasing productivity, improving time and cost
                efficiencies, delivering a better customer experience and automating business processes.</p>
            <p>Our customers are channel partners looking to reinvent themselves or requiring guidance to support their
                customer’s evolution from today to tomorrow.</p>
            <p>If all this means “fresh” or “new” to you, we welcome the opportunity to serve you.</p>
