                <p>"As a proud Indigenous man, I believe the only way to closing the gap is through employment and
                    engagement across this country. We have seen many programs of works that have focused purely on
                    education, with a limit of work or meaningful employment at the end of such programs
                    causing a vacuum of educated individuals with no career prospects.</p>
                <p>At Kalinda IT we are focused on enabling pathways and self-determination for First Nations people
                    across Australia. Establishing proper educational pathways means we need to engage indigenous youth
                    early as they are leaving school (15- and 16- year-olds) with a proper Apprenticeship program for IT
                    sector.</p>
                <p>Our commitment and focus are directed towards creating the ability for Indigenous youth to form
                    their own pathways. We will achieve that through providing them with their first education within IT
                    and also guidance on how to build personal wealth, understand money and the ways to maintain it.</p>
                <p>Having looked to partner with educational organisations, it has been clear to there is no program
                    available today that allows us to focus on IT as a trade. As an organisation we have set forward the
                    process to create and maintain a project works, that will cover both education through employment,
                    with a focus on maintaining connection to country and jobs in community.</p>
                <p>Our commitment is funded through 10% of our profits. These profits are generated though our
                    partnerships with vendors, Service Provides, customers and other companies (partners) who are also
                    working towards greater empowerment of Indigenous People and Youth.</p>
                <p>True commitment comes through visibility of programs and services being offered. We are partnering
                    with some leading providers of platforms that will allow our partners to track where 10% of our
                    profits directly being spent, offering them the ability to participate the entire journey of our
                    Indigenous Youth and their Apprenticeships.</p>
                <p>To do this we’ve been working with our vendor partners on lowering the age required for the entry
                    certifications. This will enable us to work in line with established pathways, whilst being able to
                    employee and work with young individuals as they are coming through their formative years.</p>
